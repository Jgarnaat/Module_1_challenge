# Code Refactor Starter Code
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This webpage was changed, in the semantic tense, to clean up and have a more organized version with proper element names related to their position on the webpage.

A more descriptive title was given to the webpage so it could easily be identified by its tab name.

The headers (H1-H4) were organized and serialized to be more logical in their layout.

The process of reviewing and refining this code should make it easier for a future developer to view this code and locate the elements they wish to edit. 

I also added alt text as the pictures initially had no alternative texts for screen readers

## Patch notes

v1.1.2
Changed title from "webpage" to "HoriSEOn Social Solutions"
